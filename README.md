### This is an exercise in expediant syntax learning, I found out yesterday(7/9) that I will be given a technical interview in Python on Friday (7/13). Instead of passing on the opportunity, I thought it would be fun to see exactly how well I could do with this limited preparation time. Therefore I will be doing as much as I can to jam Python into my head, in the hopes of expanding my skillset and maybe making it past the interview. Wish me luck!
